1. Create a Animal  Class with attributes.
2. Create a animal class inheritance (Inheritance allows us to create a new class from an existing class.)
3. A triangle is a polygon with 3 sides. 
So, we can create a class called Triangle which  
 s = (a + b + c) / 2
 area = (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)) ** 0.5
 class triangle()
